## CampPing

My friend and I are building a campsite notification email service, mostly to help us (and our friends) plan last minute camping trips since we're all pretty bad about booking sites in advance. It also has the ability to send email notifications of cancelled sites so you can snag last minute sites at booked up campgrounds like Yosemite!

It's in a very early beta, but if you want...

## FogLater

I often use [fog.today](https://fog.today/) to check where the fog is at in San Francisco to help determine how many layers I'll need when I take my dog to the park. I'm working on building a website to predict where the fog will be around 4-6pm (my dog walking time) on any given day based on the images gathered in the morning.

There's currently no website, I'm currently developing the modeling solution. I will update this website once I've made progress.
