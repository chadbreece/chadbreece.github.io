# Welcome to my website!

This is a place for me to display my professional portfolio as well as show off any side projects I've worked on or hobbies I've pursued. You can think of this as a choose your own adventure, depending on which side of me you want to explore. I mostly built it so I can stay organized and keep track of my projects that I've worked on, and have something to show for them when I move on to the next thing. It's also good motivation to actually finish projects, so I get the satisfaction of posting it here.

So, what do you want to explore?

# Resume

[Here is a link to my resume](./resume.md)

TL;DR 

I have a Master's in Statistics and a Bachelor's in Mathematics. Day to day, I work with data and build models, and sometimes work on side projects to solve problems or learn new things. The rest of the time, I'm probably making coffee, rock climbing, camping, or hiking with my dog.

# Side Projects

[Here is a link to my side projects](./side-projects.md)

Most of them are either machine learning modeling, data analysis, or other coding projects that just generally interest me or make the world a better place. I'll try to keep them updated as I work on them.
